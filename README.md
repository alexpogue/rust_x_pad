`cargo build --release`

# Usage

One time pad is a theoretically unbreakable encryption technique. It requires the two parties to have previously shared a secret, single-use key at least as long as the message to be encrypted.

This tool lets you generate keys and encode/decode data.

Random keys are hard to produce and the keys generated by this tool are not truly random.

### Generate a key:

```./rust_x_pad -g SIZE_IN_MB -o OUTPUT_FILE```

For example, generate a 100mb key and output to a file
```./rust_x_pad -g 100 -o secret.key```

### Encrypt/decrypt a message:

```./rust_x_pad KEY MESSAGE```

Both parameters are relative file paths. The message will be encrypted or decrypted with the provided key.
